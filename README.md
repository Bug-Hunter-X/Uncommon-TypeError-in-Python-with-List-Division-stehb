This repository demonstrates an uncommon TypeError that can occur in Python when performing division involving lists. The example function `function_with_uncommon_error` attempts to handle ZeroDivisionError and TypeError exceptions. However, when a list is provided as input, it unexpectedly raises a TypeError related to unsupported operand types for division between an integer and a list.  The solution explores alternative ways to handle such inputs to gracefully manage this unusual error scenario.
